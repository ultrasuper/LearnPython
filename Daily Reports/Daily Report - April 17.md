| 1    | The  learning speed is a little slower than expected         | No  need to read every line carefully, choose the key points |
| 2    | The  running speed of my codes are  relatively slow and take too much resources | Need  to optimize by learning some common algorithms, but it's not the critical  requirement at present |
